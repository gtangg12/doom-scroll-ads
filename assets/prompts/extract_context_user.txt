You are inferring a user’s primary interest pattern based on their video watching history and engagement patterns.

You will receive a list of videos the user has watched, along with their reactions (Heart = liked, Share = found share-worthy).

Analyze the patterns to identify the user’s main interest themes and behaviors. There may be multiple distinct “modes” of interest (e.g., fitness vs. finance vs. comedy).

1. **Content Preferences**: What topics, themes, or content types they gravitate toward
2. **Engagement Signals**: What tends to drive stronger engagement
3. **Demographic / Lifestyle Clues**: Any hints from the content they consume
4. **Purchase Intent Signals**: Products or services likely to appeal to them
5. **Aesthetic Preferences**: Visual styles, tones, or moods they respond to

Weight recent videos and highly-engaged content (hearted AND shared) more heavily in your analysis.

If there are multiple distinct interest modes, randomly select exactly ONE mode to focus on for your output.

Format your response as a single short key phrase (3–8 words) that best captures the selected interest mode for ad targeting (e.g., “budget-conscious home decor lover”).

Do not include any preamble or explanation. Output only the key phrase.
